# LMA_Coruzzi_internship_codes
To make the codes work, you must first download all of the programs in  this project.
Then, it is possible to visualize the various results by "running" the code of your choice among the ones including the word "affichage" in its name.
The parameters that can be varied for each of the cases can be modified here directly from the "affichage" files.
